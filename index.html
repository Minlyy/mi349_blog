            <h2>Elden Ring Review</h2>
            <img alt="Elden Ring image" src="elden-ring-world-tree.jpg">
            <p>
                Elden Ring is a ARPG (action role-playing game) that was developed by FromSoftware and released 
                in 2022. In the game the player controls a character known as a Tarnished who has just arrived 
                to the Lands Between. Tarnished are individuals who were banished from the Lands Between losing 
                the grace from the Erdtree, a humongous golden tree that could be seen almost everywhere. After 
                the shattering of the Elden Ring the Tarnished were beckoned by lost grace from the Erdtree to 
                return and repair the Elden Ring to become the new Elden Lord. The game is played through a third 
                person perspective with players being able to freely roam the open world. There are several 
                equipment and item slots that players could use to equip various types of weapons, armors, runes,
                 and skills. There are 8 different stats which the player could allocate to by using the skill 
                 points they get by leveling. The character is very customizable with tons of different builds 
                 that players could make. Just like the souls game Elden Ring combat is slow and reactive. 
                 Enemies in Elden Ring are able to block or parry the player`s attack which leads to the player 
                 losing their posture and easily getting hit. For most builds in the game player will die in 
                 around 5 to 8 hits without using any healing. Players are able to roll in all 4 directions 
                 to avoid enemy attacks. During combat with enemy players are able to lock the camera`s on 
                 the enemy following their movements.
